# W_CS_SortString

Using Visual Studio, create a new console application project. Name the project SortString. 

Define a string. Then use the String.Split method to separate the string into an array of words.

Call the Array.Sort method to sort the array of words.

Call the String.Join method to convert the array of words back into a single string, and then write the string to the console.
